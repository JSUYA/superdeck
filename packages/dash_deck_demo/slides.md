# What is Flutter?

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, desktop, and embedded devices from a single codebase.

Flutter is free and open source, and its creation has been driven by the fact that developers have long desired an uncompromising UI that allows for creative expression, but is also easy to create and has great developer and tooling experience.
